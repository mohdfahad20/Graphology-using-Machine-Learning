# Graphology-using-Machine-Learning

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This project dives into the study of graphology to predict personality traits using machine learning. We created our own dataset by collecting handwriting samples from colleagues, then analyzed and trained the model using a <strong>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</strong>. The model processes handwriting images and outputs a detailed personality profile.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Custom dataset created from real handwriting samples.</li>
  <li>CNN architecture optimized for high-accuracy personality prediction.</li>
  <li>Insightful results that reflect handwriting characteristics and inferred personality traits.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Combines traditional handwriting analysis with modern deep learning.</li>
  <li>Demonstrates how AI can reveal personality traits through handwriting analysis.</li>
</ul>
